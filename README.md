### Plots with two different scales
This project demonstrates how to do two plots on the same axes with different left and
right scales.

Difference between Dynamic Time Warping distance and Euclidean distance mapping audio signals in time series.
The former allows many-to-one point comparisons, while Euclidean one-to-one distance.

The red line represents waveform of audio sample with dynamic time interval between signals while the blue line represents frequencies with constant time scale.

Two independent y axes are mapped to x axis which represents intervals (sample count in time series).

The axes are generated by calling the Axes.twinx method. Likewise,
Axes.twiny is available to generate axes that share y axis but
have different top and bottom scales.

### Classification of Flamenco footwork exercise
In Flamenco dance, an escobilla is where the dancer does an extended section of zapateado (footwork).
The project analyze 10seconds record sample data of José Manuel Álvarez performance of Siguiriyas in 161bpm count and visualize on graph.
Siguiriyas is one of flamenco's most difficult dance forms, and a dancer's first job is to master the compás.
Siguiriyas pattern has two short, two long, and one short (counted as: 1 and 2 and 3 and a 4 and a 5 and):
The underlying compás for siguiriyas is a 12 count pattern with beats grouped as 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, and with an accent on the first beat of each group.
siguiriyas pattern has two short, two long, and one short (counted as: 1 and 2 and 3 and a 4 and 5).
